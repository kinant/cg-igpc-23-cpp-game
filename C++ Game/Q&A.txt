1. Need a refresh on forward declaring classes. Previously it was used once, for the key. But in later modules it is used much more extensively. 

2. Using a default for destructor. They just use it with no explanation as to what it does. Would like to know what it is/does?
   Example: virtual ~GameState() = default;

3. Need help explaining this:
	std::string FileName = "highscores.txt";
	std::ifstream HighScoreFile(FileName);
	std::istream_iterator<int> Start(HighScoreFile), End;
	std::set<int> HighScores(Start, End);

	//..
	std::ostream_iterator<int> Output_Iterator(OutFile, "\n");
	std::copy(HighScores.begin(), HighScores.end(), Output_Iterator);
	OutFile.close();

Actually, it would be helpful if we could do a walkthrough of the "Utility.h" file. 

3. What is going on in this loop? Reverse begin and reverse end? 
	for (auto i = m_HighScores.rbegin(); i != m_HighScores.rend(); ++i) 
	{
		cout << "            " << *i << endl;
	}
